      <p class = "history-text-1">Besides significant developments in coronavirus, the following words were carved out on many mountains: <i>Orwell* would not be surprised to hear about our country
      Huxley* would silently agree with everything
      There is a fallen currency (tenge) in front of my eyes
      And tender(bid) dementors with thirsty dry lips</i></p>

      <p class = "history-text-2">By this time, people had gained their own land in the middle of Eurasia. Frederick, and Gregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne evidently resolved to settle accounts with this young man at any cost.  He excommunicated him.
